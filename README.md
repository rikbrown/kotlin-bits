# kotlin-pieces

Pieces of Kotlin to make coding easier.  Includes types, extensions and various helper utilities I've written on my little Kotlin projects.  Nothing is 
promised to be amazing, but they've helped me out.

## Changes

### 0.1

* Changed version number from snapshot.
* Added a couple of temporary directory and multimap tools
* TODO: refactor previous code from overly generic "extensions" and "utils" packages

## Usage

At some point I'll write something here.

## Development notes

### Testing

Yeah, I haven't written any tests yet mainly because they were shonkily tested indirectly through my projects.  That's high on my todo.
